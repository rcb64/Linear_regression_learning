🚀 Key Contributions & Features from Radu Bizga Nicolescu:
1️⃣ Machine Learning & Data Science Techniques
✅ Multiple Linear Regression – Built a predictive model for NYC rent prices using scikit-learn.
✅ Feature Engineering – Selected and processed continuous & discrete variables to improve model accuracy.
✅ Data Visualization – Created insightful box plots, scatter plots, and correlation analyses with Seaborn & Matplotlib.

2️⃣ Distance Metrics & Similarity Analysis
✅ Implemented Key Distance Metrics for machine learning:

Euclidean Distance – Standard geometric distance calculation.
Manhattan Distance – Useful for grid-based paths.
Hamming Distance – Measures binary string differences.
✅ Optimized with SciPy – Used scipy.spatial.distance for efficient computations.
3️⃣ k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm
✅ Built a k-NN Distance Function for comparing movies based on attributes.
✅ Extended to N-Dimensions – Generalized the function for high-dimensional data.

4️⃣ Data Normalization for Better Comparisons
✅ Implemented Min-Max Normalization – Scaled movie release dates and numerical data between 0 and 1 for consistency.

5️⃣ Code Optimization & Performance Improvements
✅ Refactored Loops for Efficiency – Improved calculations with optimized Pythonic implementations.
✅ Error Handling & Input Validation – Ensured robustness by handling dimension mismatches in distance functions.
